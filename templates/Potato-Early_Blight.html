                        Early blight in potato (Alternaria solani) is, along with mildew, one of the most significant diseases affecting this crop</br>
                        <b>Disease symptoms:</b><br>
                        <b>-></b> This is a common disease of potato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth and causes characteristic leaf spots and blight.<br>
                        <b>-></b> Normally the disease symptoms become apparent during tuber bulking stage and develop leading to the harvest.<br>
                        <b>-></b> The early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.<br>
                        <b>-></b> Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.<br>
                        <b>-></b> Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.<br>
                        <b>-></b> Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.<br>
                    </br>

                    <h6 style="padding: 15px ;background-color:aliceblue;justify-self: center; display: block;">
                    
                    <b>1.</b> Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.<br>
                    <b>2.</b> Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.<br>
                    <b>3.</b> Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.<br>
                    <b>4.</b> Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.<br>
                    <b>5.</b> For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.<br>
                    <b>6.</b> Containing copper and pyrethrins, BonideÂ® Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.<br>
                    <b>7.</b> SERENADE Garden is a broad spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.<br>
                    <b>8.</b> Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.
                    <b>9.</b> Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.
